# Frankie Financial - Coding Test

## Project description

Build a simple RESTful service based of a Swagger/OpenAPI v2.0 definition.<br>
There is a single POST endpoint that takes a JSON payload which needs to be validated
according to predefined rules.<br>
If the validation is successful then a simple JSON structure is returned, otherwise
an error response returns a description of all issues found.
